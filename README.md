# Community Ecosystem Map

### Why ?

The Community Ecosystem Map is a Tool for all the people out there that are looking for meaningful relationships and real community. For everyone, who has the desire to reconnect with the ecosystem and socio-sphere around and who wants to step out of his/her bubble at home and finde like-minded people, projects and places. 

### How ?

The Community Ecosystem Map is a tool for collaborative mapping. It makes local initiatives, people and events visible and enables real life decentralized networking. It's also an invitation to reconnect with our environment and the community around us to actively shape our collective future and start growing a decentralized network of people, projects and events all over the world, starting in our local neighborhood. That way it can also become the bridge between virtual Web3 solutions and the true physical reality.

### What?

It does so by providing a geographic map web application what is showing all items and allows the user to sign up and add projects, events and his personal profile to the map.

This map is showing the moos ecosystem using the [Utopia-UI](https://github.com/utopia-os/utopia-ui) Components.

### Implementation

The map is visualizing the  ecosystem within and around the Moos community while using the building blocks of the [Utopia UI Framework](https://github.com/utopia-os/utopia-ui). During the Code 2 Community Hackathon I [extended the capabilities of that framework](https://github.com/utopia-os/utopia-ui/compare/5fd1fc4de100b77e57d9a18a72925ca6ea5e96f5...ea31a5672bd2b1262142f66a53ee0be801a4c2c3?w=1) to make the manifold relations between project, events and community members visible and to include also projects without an specific geographic location.

Being present during the Hackathon at Moos, there was a close interaction with other teams. 
The  [Moos Knowledge Garden Team]()  was providing a valuable data set which was imported with the help of the [Obsidian Node Canvas]() project, which was also ways to enrich the map with crawled web data and the help of vector embedding.
